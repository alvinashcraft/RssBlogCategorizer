## Fix #1: Multi-Author Formatting Edge Case (rssProvider.ts ~line 574)

### Issue
The multi-author formatting logic didn't handle the case where `authors.length === 0` after filtering. If all comma-separated parts were empty strings, the author variable would remain unchanged with the original comma-separated value instead of being set to a fallback value.

### Solution
Added explicit handling for the empty authors array case:

```typescript
if (author.includes(',')) {
    const authors = author.split(',').map(a => a.trim()).filter(a => a.length > 0);
    if (authors.length === 0) {
        author = 'unknown';  // NEW: Handle empty array case
    } else if (authors.length === 1) {
        author = authors[0];
    } else if (authors.length === 2) {
        author = `${authors[0]} & ${authors[1]}`;
    } else {
        // 3+ authors
        const lastAuthor = authors[authors.length - 1];
        const otherAuthors = authors.slice(0, -1);
        author = `${otherAuthors.join(', ')} & ${lastAuthor}`;
    }
}
```

### Benefits
- Prevents edge case where author could contain only commas or whitespace
- More robust error handling
- Logical flow from smallest to largest (0, 1, 2, 3+)

## Fix #2: Non-Null Assertion Operator Risk (rssProvider.ts lines 894, 905, 917)

### Issue
Using non-null assertion operator (`!`) was risky. While there was a null check at line 877, the code would be more robust using a local variable to prevent potential runtime errors if the config became null between the check and usage.

### Solution
Stored the config in a local constant after the null check:

```typescript
private applyAuthorMappings(): void {
    if (!this.authorMappingsConfig) {
        console.log('❌ Author mappings not loaded, skipping author name updates');
        return;
    }

    // Store config in local variable to avoid repeated property access and ensure type safety
    const config = this.authorMappingsConfig;

    // ... rest of the code now uses 'config' instead of 'this.authorMappingsConfig!'
    for (const mapping of config.urlContains) { ... }
    for (const mapping of config.authorContains) { ... }
    for (const mapping of config.authorExact) { ... }
}
```

### Benefits
- Eliminates all non-null assertion operators (`!`)
- Better TypeScript type safety
- Improved performance (single property access vs. multiple)
- More robust code following best practices

## Fix #3: Consolidated Geek Shelf Link (exportManager.ts ~line 378)

### Issue
The image link and title link used the same URL (`book.productUrl`) but were wrapped separately in two different anchor tags. This created unnecessary HTML complexity and reduced accessibility.

### Solution
Consolidated the image and title into a single anchor tag:

**Before (2 separate anchor tags):**
```html
<a href="..."><img src="..." /></a>
<div>
    <a href="...">Book Title</a> (Author)
    <p>Description</p>
</div>
```

**After (1 consolidated anchor tag):**
```html
<a href="..." style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 15px; ...">
    <img src="..." style="width: 100px; height: auto; flex-shrink: 0;">
    <div>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0066cc;">Book Title</span> (Author)
        <p>Description</p>
    </div>
</a>
```

### Benefits
- Reduced HTML complexity (1 anchor instead of 2)
- Improved accessibility (single cohesive clickable area)
- Clearer semantic structure
- Maintains identical visual appearance
- Better for screen readers and assistive technologies

## Fix #4: Unix Timestamp Handling (rssProvider.ts ~line 568)

### Issue
NewsBlur API returns dates as Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch) in string format, while RSS feeds return ISO date strings. This caused incorrect date comparisons during filtering, allowing posts that should have been excluded based on their share date.

### Solution
Added proper detection and conversion of Unix timestamps to ISO format:

```typescript
// NewsBlur returns Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch) as strings
// Convert to ISO format for consistent date handling
let pubDate = '';
const rawDate = story.shared_date || story.story_date || '';
if (rawDate) {
    // Check if it's a Unix timestamp (all digits) vs ISO string
    if (/^\d+$/.test(rawDate)) {
        // Unix timestamp - convert to ISO string
        const timestamp = parseInt(rawDate, 10);
        pubDate = new Date(timestamp * 1000).toISOString();
    } else {
        // Already an ISO string or other format
        pubDate = rawDate;
    }
}
```

### Benefits
- Accurate date comparisons regardless of source format
- Eliminates timezone-related edge cases
- No hard-coded buffers needed - existing logic works correctly
- Improved debugging with time difference logging

## Fix #5: Magic Number Constants (rssProvider.ts lines 980, 1018, 1106)

### Issue
Magic numbers and recreated arrays reduced code readability and maintainability:
- `1000 * 60` calculation appeared multiple times without clear meaning
- `monthNames` array was recreated on every method call, wasting memory and CPU

### Solution
Extracted values into class-level constants:

```typescript
// Class-level constants for better readability and performance
private static readonly MILLISECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 1000 * 60;
private static readonly MONTH_NAMES = ['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'may', 'jun', 'jul', 'aug', 'sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec'];

// Usage examples:
const timeDiffMinutes = Math.round((minimumDateTime.getTime() - postDate.getTime()) / RSSBlogProvider.MILLISECONDS_PER_MINUTE);
minimumDateTime = new Date(lastDewDropDate.getTime() + (5 * RSSBlogProvider.MILLISECONDS_PER_MINUTE));
const monthSuffix = RSSBlogProvider.MONTH_NAMES[now.getMonth()];
```

### Benefits
- Improved readability - intent is immediately clear
- Better maintainability - change once, affects all usages
- Performance improvement - array created once, not on every call
- Memory efficiency - single instance shared across all calls
- Consistent with existing class constant patterns
