## Usage

### Getting Started

1. After installation, the "Dev Blog Posts" view will appear in the Explorer panel sidebar
2. The extension comes pre-configured with a default RSS feed
3. **Click the refresh button** in the view header to load posts (no automatic refresh on startup)
4. Posts are automatically categorized and displayed in a tree structure
5. **Optional**: Enable auto-refresh in settings if you want automatic updates

### Setting Up Your RSS Feed

3. Enter your RSS feed URL when prompted

Click the refresh button to load new content after updating the feed URL.

### Manual vs Automatic Refresh

By default, the extension uses **manual refresh** for better performance and control:

- **Manual Mode** (default): Click the refresh button when you want to check for new posts
- **Automatic Mode** (optional): Enable "Auto Refresh" in settings for periodic updates

Manual refresh is recommended for most users as it prevents unnecessary network requests and provides better control over when data is updated.

### NewsBlur API Integration (Optional)

For enhanced functionality, you can configure NewsBlur API access to retrieve more than 25 items:

1. **Enable NewsBlur API**: Set `rssBlogCategorizer.useNewsblurApi` to `true` in settings
2. **Set Username**: Configure your NewsBlur username in `rssBlogCategorizer.newsblurUsername`
3. **Set Credentials**: Use Command Palette ‚Üí "RSS Blog Categorizer: Set NewsBlur Credentials" to securely store your password

**Benefits of NewsBlur API:**

- Access more than 25 feed items (RSS feeds are typically limited to 25)
- More reliable access to popular feeds
- Better handling of feed redirects and updates

### Exporting Posts

**Via Explorer Panel:**

1. Click "Export as Markdown" or "Export as HTML" from the "Dev Blog Posts" view menu

**Via Command Palette:**

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Run "RSS Blog Categorizer: Export as Markdown" or "RSS Blog Categorizer: Export as HTML"

**Export Process:**

1. Choose your save location (filename is auto-generated from the blog post title)
2. The exported file will include:
   - Auto-generated "Dew Drop" title with incremental numbering
   - Categorized posts with author attribution
   - "The Geek Shelf" section with book recommendations

**Default Filename**: Files are automatically named using the blog post title, for example:

- `Dew_Drop_October_11_2025_4517.html`
- `Dew_Drop_October_11_2025_4517.md`

### Publishing to WordPress

After exporting to HTML, you can publish directly to your WordPress blog:

**Prerequisites:**

1. **Configure WordPress Settings**: Set your blog URL and username in settings
2. **Set Credentials**: Use Command Palette ‚Üí "RSS Blog Categorizer: Set WordPress Credentials" to securely store your login

**Publishing Process:**

1. **Export to HTML** first using the export functionality above

3. **Click the WordPress publish button** in the editor toolbar (cloud upload icon)
   - Or use Command Palette ‚Üí "RSS Blog Categorizer: Publish to WordPress"
   - Only the content inside `<body>` tags is published (excludes `<html>`, `<head>`, etc.)
4. **Choose categories**: Use default categories (configurable in settings), customize for this post, or publish without categories
5. **Review auto-detected tags**: The extension automatically detects technology tags from content - use detected tags, customize them, or skip
6. **Choose publish status**: Publish immediately or save as draft
7. **Confirmation**: The extension will confirm successful publication with the post ID, assigned categories, and tag count

**WordPress Setup Requirements:**

- WordPress site with REST API enabled (enabled by default in WordPress 4.7+)

**Automatic Tag Detection:**

The extension automatically analyzes your blog post content and detects relevant technology tags including:

The system intelligently matches content against a comprehensive technology keyword database and presents detected tags for your review before publishing.

**Security Notes:**

- WordPress credentials are stored securely using VS Code's built-in SecretStorage
- Passwords are never stored in plain text or configuration files
- Use WordPress Application Passwords for enhanced security when available

**Note**: Tags are automatically detected from content and don't require configuration - the system analyzes your blog post and suggests relevant technology tags during publishing.

### Smart Date Filtering

The extension uses intelligent date filtering:

1. **Automatic Mode** (default): Uses the publication date of the latest "Dew Drop" post from alvinashcraft.com
2. **Fallback**: If unavailable, filters to posts from the last 24 hours (UTC)
3. **Manual Override**: Set a custom UTC datetime in settings

Example UTC formats:

- `2025-01-01T00:00:00Z` (midnight UTC)
- `2025-09-27T12:00:00.000Z` (with milliseconds)

## Category Customization
