# WYSIWYG Editor Implementation - v2.0.0

## Overview
Successfully implemented a TinyMCE-based WYSIWYG editor for the RSS Blog Categorizer extension. This feature allows you to visually edit exported HTML blog posts before publishing them to WordPress.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **New Files Created**
- **`src/editorManager.ts`** - Core editor management class that handles webview creation, TinyMCE initialization, and content updates
- **`webview/editor.html`** - HTML template for the TinyMCE editor interface with VS Code theming
- **`media/tinymce/`** - Complete TinyMCE library copied from node_modules (all necessary assets, plugins, themes, and skins)

### 2. **Modified Files**

#### `src/extension.ts`
- Added import for `EditorManager`
- Created `editorManager` instance
- Registered new command: `rssBlogCategorizer.openWysiwygEditor`
- Command opens the WYSIWYG editor for any active HTML file
- Integrated with existing WordPress publishing workflow

#### `src/exportManager.ts`
- Added prompt after HTML export to optionally open the file in the WYSIWYG editor
- Provides seamless workflow: Export ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Publish

#### `package.json`
- Added `tinymce` dependency (v8.1.2)
- Added `copy-webpack-plugin` dev dependency
- Registered new command with edit icon in editor toolbar
- Added menu contribution to show edit button when viewing HTML files
- Updated version to 2.0.0

#### `webpack.config.js`
- Added `CopyPlugin` to copy `media/` and `webview/` directories during build
- Ensures TinyMCE assets are included in the compiled extension

#### `tsconfig.json`
- Excluded `media`, `webview`, and `dist` directories from TypeScript compilation
- Prevents TypeScript from trying to compile TinyMCE's `.ts` skin files

#### `.vscodeignore`
- Added exceptions to include `media/**` and `webview/**` in the packaged extension
- Ensures all necessary assets are distributed with the extension

## Features

### VS Code Integration
- **Native Theming**: Editor respects VS Code color themes
