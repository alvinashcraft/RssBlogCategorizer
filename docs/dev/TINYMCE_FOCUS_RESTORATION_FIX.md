# TinyMCE Focus Restoration Fix - October 23, 2025

## Issue

The TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor was losing focus when users switched between applications (e.g., Alt+Tab to another application and back to VS Code). After returning to VS Code, users couldn't immediately start typing and had to manually click inside the editor to regain focus. The cursor position was also not being preserved.

## Root Cause

The focus issue was caused by several factors:

1. **No Window Focus Handling**: The webview didn't detect when VS Code regained focus after being in the background
2. **Missing Cursor Position Preservation**: The editor wasn't saving and restoring cursor position when focus was lost/gained
3. **No Panel Visibility Management**: The extension didn't handle focus restoration when the webview panel became visible
4. **Lack of Periodic Focus Maintenance**: No fallback mechanism to ensure the editor maintained focus during extended use

## Solution

### 1. **Cursor Position Preservation**

Added bookmark-based cursor position saving and restoration:

```javascript
// Store cursor position when editor loses focus
editor.on('blur', function() {
    var bookmark = editor.selection.getBookmark(2, true);
    vscode.setState({ 
        content: editor.getContent(),
        isDirty: vscode.getState()?.isDirty || false,
        cursorPosition: bookmark
    });
});

// Restore cursor position when editor gains focus
editor.on('focus', function() {
    var state = vscode.getState();
    if (state && state.cursorPosition) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            try {
                editor.selection.moveToBookmark(state.cursorPosition);
            } catch (e) {
                // If bookmark restoration fails, place cursor at end
                editor.selection.select(editor.getBody(), true);
                editor.selection.collapse(false);
            }
        }, 50);
    }
});
```

### 2. **Window Focus Event Handling**

Added comprehensive window focus detection for Alt+Tab scenarios:

```javascript
// Track when the window loses focus
window.addEventListener('blur', function() {
    lastFocusTime = Date.now();
});

// Track when the window regains focus
window.addEventListener('focus', function() {
    var timeSinceFocus = Date.now() - lastFocusTime;
    
    // If focus was lost for more than 100ms, restore focus to editor
    if (timeSinceFocus > 100 && tinymce.activeEditor) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            tinymce.activeEditor.focus();
        }, 100);
    }
});
```

### 3. **Visibility API Integration**

Added Page Visibility API support for more reliable focus detection:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', function() {
    if (!document.hidden && tinymce.activeEditor) {
        // Page became visible, restore focus after short delay
        setTimeout(function() {
            tinymce.activeEditor.focus();
        }, 150);
    }
});
```

### 4. **Panel Visibility Management**

Enhanced the EditorManager to handle webview panel visibility changes:

```typescript
// Handle panel visibility changes to restore focus
this.panel.onDidChangeViewState(
    (e) => {
        if (e.webviewPanel.visible) {
            // Panel became visible, request focus restoration
            setTimeout(() => {
                this.panel?.webview.postMessage({
                    command: 'focusEditor'
                });
            }, 200); // Delay to ensure panel is fully rendered
        }
    },
    null,
    this.context.subscriptions
);
```

### 5. **Periodic Focus Maintenance**

Added a fallback focus check mechanism:

```javascript
function startFocusCheck() {
    focusCheckInterval = setInterval(function() {
        // Only restore focus if no button is focused
        var activeElement = document.activeElement;
        var isButtonFocused = activeElement && (/* check for buttons */);
        
        // If no button is focused and editor doesn't have focus
        if (!isButtonFocused && tinymce.activeEditor && !tinymce.activeEditor.hasFocus()) {
            tinymce.activeEditor.focus();
        }
    }, 2000); // Check every 2 seconds
}
```

### 6. **Enhanced Message Handling**

Added explicit focus command handling:

```javascript
case 'focusEditor':
    // Handle explicit focus requests from extension
    if (tinymce.activeEditor) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            tinymce.activeEditor.focus();
        }, 50);
    }
    break;
```

## Testing

### How to Test Focus Restoration

1. **Alt+Tab Test**:
   - Open the WYSIWYG editor
   - Place cursor in a specific position in the text
   - Alt+Tab to another application (e.g., browser)
   - Alt+Tab back to VS Code
   - ✅ Focus should return to the editor with cursor in the same position

2. **Window Minimize Test**:
   - Open the WYSIWYG editor
   - Minimize VS Code window
   - Restore VS Code window
   - ✅ Focus should return to the editor

3. **Panel Switching Test**:
   - Open the WYSIWYG editor
   - Switch to another VS Code panel/tab
   - Switch back to the WYSIWYG editor
   - ✅ Focus should return to the editor

### Expected Behavior

- ✅ Focus returns to TinyMCE editor after Alt+Tab or window switching
- ✅ Cursor position is preserved and restored accurately
- ✅ No need to manually click in the editor to start typing
- ✅ Works across different window focus scenarios
- ✅ Doesn't interfere with button focus or other UI elements

## Technical Details

### Focus Detection Methods

1. **Window Focus Events**: Primary method for Alt+Tab detection
2. **Visibility API**: Backup method for tab/window visibility changes  
3. **Panel Visibility**: VS Code webview panel visibility management
4. **Periodic Checks**: Fallback mechanism for edge cases

### Cursor Position Technology

- **TinyMCE Bookmarks**: Uses TinyMCE's built-in bookmark system for precise cursor position
- **VS Code State**: Leverages VS Code's webview state management for persistence
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if bookmark restoration fails

### Performance Considerations

- **Debounced Focus**: Uses timeouts to prevent excessive focus calls
- **Smart Timing**: Different delays for different focus scenarios
- **Resource Efficient**: Periodic checks only run when needed

## Files Modified

- `webview/editor.html` - Enhanced focus management and cursor position preservation
- `src/editorManager.ts` - Added panel visibility focus restoration

## Compilation Status

✅ Code compiles successfully with no errors or warnings  
✅ All tests pass

## User Experience Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Lost focus after Alt+Tab, required manual clicking
- ❌ Cursor position was lost
- ❌ Interrupted typing workflow

### After Fix  
- ✅ Seamless focus restoration after Alt+Tab
- ✅ Cursor position preserved exactly where user left it
- ✅ Uninterrupted typing workflow
- ✅ Professional editor experience matching native applications
