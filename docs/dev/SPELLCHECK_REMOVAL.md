# TinyMCE Spellcheck Removal - v2.1.2

## Background

During the v2.1.2 release cycle, we discovered that TinyMCE deprecated the free spellcheck plugin in version 5.4 and completely removed it in version 6.0. Since our extension uses TinyMCE 8.1.2, the spellcheck-related configuration we had implemented was non-functional.

## Changes Made

### Code Cleanup

1. **Removed deprecated TinyMCE configuration options:**
   - `browser_spellcheck: true`
   - `gecko_spellcheck: true`
   - `contextmenu: 'spellchecker'`
   - `contextmenu_never_use_native: false`
   - `iframe_attrs: { spellcheck: 'true' }`

2. **Removed non-functional spellcheck initialization code:**
   - Force-enabling spellcheck on iframe body element
   - Setting spellcheck attributes on document elements
   - Spellcheck-related CSS styling

3. **Updated documentation:**
   - Removed "Browser Spellcheck" feature description from README
   - Created release notes documenting the removal

## Technical Details

### TinyMCE Spellcheck Plugin History

According to TinyMCE documentation:

> "The free TinyMCE Spell Checker plugin (spellchecker) was deprecated with the release of TinyMCE 5.4. For details, see the free TinyMCE Spell Checker plugin deprecation notice. The free Spell Checker plugin will be removed in TinyMCE 6.0."

### Impact on Users

**Minimal impact:** Modern browsers provide built-in spellcheck functionality that works in contenteditable areas (which TinyMCE uses). Users will still get spellcheck functionality through their browser's native capabilities, though the visual presentation may differ slightly from the previously attempted TinyMCE integration.

### Files Modified

- `webview/editor.html` - Removed deprecated TinyMCE spellcheck configuration
- `README.md` - Removed references to spellcheck features
- `release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_2.1.2.md` - Documented the removal

## Lessons Learned

1. **Third-party dependency awareness:** Always check the deprecation status of features in third-party libraries, especially when upgrading versions significantly.

2. **Feature validation:** Verify that configured features are actually functional, especially for UI/UX features that may fail silently.

3. **Documentation alignment:** Keep documentation in sync with actual functionality to avoid promising features that don't work.

## Future Considerations

If advanced spellcheck functionality is needed in the future, options include:

1. **TinyMCE Premium Spellcheck:** TinyMCE offers a premium spellcheck plugin with advanced features
2. **Browser-based solutions:** Rely on modern browser spellcheck capabilities
3. **Third-party libraries:** Integrate dedicated spellcheck libraries if advanced features are required

## Testing

The removal was tested to ensure:

- [x] Editor still loads and functions correctly
- [x] No JavaScript errors related to removed spellcheck code
- [x] Focus management and other editor features remain intact
- [x] Compilation succeeds without warnings

This change improves code quality by removing dead code while maintaining user experience through browser-native spellcheck functionality.
